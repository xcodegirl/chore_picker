# Chore Picker & Editor

This project provides two Python GUI tools for managing and picking household chores from a JSON file.

## Files

- `chore_picker.py`: Pick a random chore from a selected category or from all chores.
- `chore_list_editor.py`: Add, edit, or delete chores in the JSON file using a user-friendly interface.
- `chore_data.json`: The data file containing all chores, organized by category.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

### 1. Pick a Random Chore
Run:
```bash
python3 chore_picker.py
```
- Select a category (or "all" for any chore).
- Click "Pick Random Chore" to see a random selection.

### 2. Edit the Chore List
Run:
```bash
python3 chore_list_editor.py
```
- Select a category.
- Add, edit, or delete chores. All changes are saved to the JSON file.

## Notes
- The JSON file must be in the same directory as the scripts.
- If you edit the JSON manually, ensure the format matches the examples.

## Example JSON Structure
```
{
  "household_chores": {
    "daily": [
      {"chore": "Make the bed", "score": 1, "time_estimate": 3},
      ...
    ],
    ...
  },
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```
