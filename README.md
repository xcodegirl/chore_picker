# Chore Picker & Editor

This project provides two Python GUI tools for managing and picking household chores from a JSON file.

## Files

- `chore_picker.py`: Pick a random chore from a selected category or from all chores.
- `chore_list_editor.py`: Add, edit, or delete chores in the JSON file using a user-friendly interface.
- `chore_data.json`: The data file containing all chores, organized by category.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

### 1. Pick a Random Chore
Run:
```bash
python3 chore_picker.py
```
- Select a category (or "all" for any chore).
- Click "Pick Random Chore" to see a random selection.

### 2. Edit the Chore List
Run:
```bash
python3 chore_list_editor.py
```
- Select a category.
- Add, edit, or delete chores. All changes are saved to the JSON file.

# Web-based Per-Person, Per-Day Chore Viewer

A web-based viewer is provided for easy per-person, per-day schedule lookup:

## How to Use the HTML Chore Viewer

1. **Generate the schedule** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   python3 generate_chore_schedule.py
   ```
   This will create `chore_schedule.json` and `chore_data.json` in the current directory.

2. **Start a local web server** in the `chore_picker` directory (required for browser security):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to:
   [http://localhost:8000/chore_day_person_view.html](http://localhost:8000/chore_day_person_view.html)

4. **Select a person, week, and day** from the dropdown menus to view their assigned chores for that day.

> **Note:** Opening the HTML file directly (with a `file://` URL) will not work due to browser security restrictions. Always use a local web server as shown above.

## Fairness Balancing in Chore Scheduling

The schedule generator (`generate_chore_schedule.py`) includes advanced fairness logic to ensure chores are distributed as evenly as possible among all participants:

- **Score and Time Balancing:**
  - Each chore has a "score" and "time_estimate" value.
  - The script checks that the total score and time assigned to each person are within configurable thresholds (see `FAIR_SCORE_DIFF` and `FAIR_TIME_DIFF` in the script).

- **Post-Processing for Fairness:**
  - After the initial schedule is created, the script can perform a post-processing step to swap chores between people, seeking to minimize the difference in total score and time.
  - This step uses a "best-of-all-pairs" swap algorithm to find the most effective swaps for balancing.
  - The process continues until the fairness thresholds are met or no further improvement is possible.
  - You can disable this step with the `--no-balance` command-line option.

- **Fairness Reporting:**
  - The script prints a summary showing the score and time range for all people, and whether the final schedule is considered "FAIR".
  - If not fair, it suggests re-running or adjusting the logic.

## Other Python Scripts

### `generate_chore_schedule.py`
- **Purpose:** Generates a fair, balanced schedule for all people, assigning daily, weekly, and monthly chores.
- **How to use:**
  ```bash
  python3 generate_chore_schedule.py
  ```
  - Outputs `chore_schedule.json` (the full schedule) and `chore_summary.json` (summary stats).
  - Use `--no-balance` to disable the fairness post-processing step if desired.
  - Prints assignment and fairness reports to the terminal.

### `generate_chore_schedule_html.py`
- **Purpose:** Creates a full, color-coded HTML table of the entire schedule for all people and days.
- **How to use:**
  ```bash
  python3 generate_chore_schedule_html.py
  ```
  - Outputs `chore_schedule.html` for easy viewing in a browser.

### `generate_chore_day_person_html.py`
- **Purpose:** Generates an HTML page showing all chores assigned to a single person for a specific week and day.
- **How to use:**
  ```bash
  python3 generate_chore_day_person_html.py --person Alice --week 2 --day Monday --output alice_week2_monday.html
  ```
  - Replace `Alice`, `2`, and `Monday` with your desired person, week, and day.
  - The output HTML file can be opened in any browser.

## Notes
- The JSON file must be in the same directory as the scripts.
- If you edit the JSON manually, ensure the format matches the examples.

## Example JSON Structure
```
{
  "household_chores": {
    "daily": [
      {"chore": "Make the bed", "score": 1, "time_estimate": 3},
      ...
    ],
    ...
  },
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```
